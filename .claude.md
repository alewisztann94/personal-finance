# Project Instructions for Claude

## Code Quality & Error Handling

**CRITICAL: Never fabricate data, mock outputs, or silence errors.**

- Errors are a feature, not a bug. They tell us what's wrong.
- Silent fallbacks hide bugs for months. Letting a bug slip by silently means YOU failed at your job.
- If something fails, let it fail loudly and explicitly.
- Never use placeholder data or fake success messages.
- Always show real output from real commands.
- If a command fails, show the actual error - don't work around it silently.

## Uncertainty & Assumptions
- If you are unsure or lack sufficient information, say so explicitly.
- Do not guess or infer missing details.
- Ask for clarification or additional inputs when needed.
- Clearly document assumptions and flag unverified ones.

## SQL Principles

- Prefer explicit, readable queries over clever ones
- Validate row counts when joins or filters are non-trivial
- Avoid SELECT * unless exploring
- Comment business logic and assumptions

## Data Verification & Sanity Checks

- Always include basic sanity checks (row counts, ranges, totals).
- Flag results that look implausible and explain why.
- Prefer small, verifiable steps over large opaque transformations.
- Test on small subsets before full runs when feasible
- Re-run end-to-end after meaningful changes
- Document surprising edge cases when discovered

## Development Philosophy

- Prefer explicit errors over silent failures
- Real data only - no mocking unless explicitly testing
- If uncertain about code behavior, run it and show actual output
- Document assumptions, but verify with real execution when possible
